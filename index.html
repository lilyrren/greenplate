                Reflecting on our journey throughout the development process, we are proud of the progress
                we have made in building GreenPlate. Despite encountering challenges along the way, such as 
                implementing complex functionalities and ensuring seamless integration between different 
                components, we have created a functional and impactful app.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning, we had no idea what we were dealing with. Every one of us was unfamiliar with the
                concepts being covered as well as GIT and Android Studio. However, through collaboration, dedication,
                and help from our mentor and Professor Roy, we were able to learn everything we needed to be successful
                and build this app. Each sprint has helped us learn more about coding architechure, design principles, design and 
                user diagram as well as how to interact with a Firebase database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, this project has given us valuable insights into software engineering principles, design patterns, and 
                modern technologies, which will undoubtedly help our future endeavors in this field, but most importantly,
                this project has taught us the most about team work. So, we are so proud of how far we have come and the app we 
                created along the way. Thank you CS 2340!
